## Abstract

Remote sensing of forests has become increasingly accessible with the use of unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAV), along with deep learning, allowing for repeated high-resolution imagery and the capturing of phenological changes at larger spatial and temporal scales. In temperate forests during autumn, leaf senescence occurs when leaves change colour and drop. However, few UAV-acquired datasets follow the same individual species throughout a growing season at the individual tree level, allowing for a multitude of applications when used with deep learning. Here, we acquired high-resolution UAV imagery over a temperate forest in Quebec, Canada on seven occasions between May and October 2021. We segmented and labeled 23,000 tree crowns from 14 different classes to train and validate a CNN for each imagery acquisition. While tree segmentation in a heterogenous forest remains challenging, UAV imagery and deep learning show high potential in mapping tree species.

The genus level classes, _Picea_ spp. and _Populus_ spp., include trees annotated at the species level (PIGL: _Picea glauca_, PIMA: _Picea mariana_, PIRU: _Picea rubens_, POGR: _Populus grandidentata_, POTR: _Populus tremuloides_). These classes were merged due to the difficulty in identifying the species or the similarities between the species.

Not included in this table are approximately 700 additional trees that were segmented and labeled and included in broader categories or in categories with too few individuals.

## Description of the data

This dataset was generated by members of the Plant Functional Ecology Laboratory ([LEFO](https://lefo.ca/)) at the Plant Biology Research Institute ([IRBV](https://irbv.umontreal.ca/)) of University of Montreal in Quebec, Canada. This includes the imagery acquisition, the field surveys for tree crown labeling, and the segmentation of the tree crowns as well as generating the products (orthomosaics, point clouds).

The imagery was acquired on seven different dates between the end of May and early October in 2021 over a temperate forest at the Laurentian Biology Station of University of Montreal in Saint-Hippolyte, Quebec, Canada. The acquisition was done using a DJI Phantom 4 RTK. The processing of the imagery was done using Agisoft Metashape Professional v.1.7.5 to generate the orthomosaics and the point clouds using Structure from motion photogrammetry. Three orthomosaics were generated for each date using a point cloud with medium density and aggressive filtering in order to minimize artifacts. The point clouds in this dataset are high density and have not been filtered for more dense point clouds. The annotations and other vector data were done using ArcGIS Pro v.2.9 and correspond to the individual tree crowns labeled at the species or genus level, or as dead trees (see Table 1 for details).
